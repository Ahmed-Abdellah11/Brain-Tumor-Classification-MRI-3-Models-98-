# Brain Tumor Classification (MRI)

**Definition:** A brain tumor is an abnormal growth of brain cells, whether in the brain tissue itself or in surrounding tissues such as the meninges or nerves associated with the brain. These tumors can be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous).

Severity: The severity of a tumor depends on its size, location, and rate of growth. Since the brain is the control center for the entire body, any pressure or damage to a specific part of the brain can cause major problems in vital body functions such as movement, sensation, vision, and memory. Cancerous tumors are more dangerous because they grow quickly and spread to other areas of the brain or body.

Types:

**Glioma:**

This is a type of tumor that affects brain cells called "glial cells", which are responsible for supporting and protecting nerve cells. Glioma usually appears in the brain or spine. On MRI: You will find an irregular area or spot in the brain that is darker or lighter than the rest of the areas.

**Meningioma:**

This is a tumor that appears in the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord (meninges). This tumor is usually benign and does not cause many problems unless it is large. On MRI: You may see an oval or round area around the brain that is separate from the brain tissue itself.

**Pituitary Tumor:**

This is a tumor that occurs in the pituitary gland, which is a small gland at the base of the brain that controls the body's hormones. On MRI: You will see the pituitary gland larger than normal or you may find small lumps around the gland.
